Data Mining Project 2

- data_preprocessing: load the data from txt file, use one-hot encoding to deal with string feature and normalize continuous value. 
- cross_vali: do 10 fold cross validation and print out accuracy, precision, recall, f1

- knn/naive_bayes/svm/decision_tree/decision_tree_boosted/random_forest: classifiers, run by command line "python xxx.py" and get 10-fold cross validation result of each dataset
